# 0. Overview :page_facing_up:

If you landed here, I guess you want to start, or you're already applying for jobs.
In this directory I'll give you a short overview of the topics I'm including
and why I think they're important. I you have a specific topic you're looking for, feel free to jump right into it.


## Topics in this Guide

+ [Strategy](/1_STRATEGY/README.md)  
  Imo having a strategy for applying is super useful. Being sure about what you want and what you have to
  offer is increasing your chance to find a great match.
  
+ [CV](/2_CV)
  Your CV is the first (and often the only) thing a recruiter sees. Most CVs get a short screening of
  only a few seconds, before the first decision is made. Putting some effort in your CV can decide if you make it to a
  process or not.
  
+ [Research](/3_RESEARCH)
  How and where to find the job that you are looking for can be overwhelming, especially with tons of job boards,
  advertisements and recruiters reaching out to you.
  
+ [Cover Letter](/4_COVER_LETTER)
  A cover letter is sometimes optional, but I will point out why I think they're 
  always a must and what to include.
  
+ [Interview Prep](/5_INTERVIEW_PREP)
  In most application processes you will have different kind of interviews.
  Preparation is necessary for all kinds of interviews, not just technical.
  
+ [Coding Task Prep](/6_CODING_TASK_PREP)
  In some interview processes you'll get asked to do a coding task. What to expect and 
  how to prepare (especially with limited time) can make it a lot easier.
