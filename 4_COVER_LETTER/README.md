# 1. Cover Letter :envelope:


## Always send a Cover Letter
Some applications require a cover letter, for others it's optional. Even if it's optional, I would 
still always include one. It's a great opportunity to show a company more about your skillset, your experience and
that you're a great match. It also shows that you really care about the opportunity, and that you are
willing to put some effort in your application.


## How to structure your cover letter

### Intro
Start with 2-3 sentences as an Intro. Make a small teaser about you, how you found out about the opportunity
and why you're applying.

### Your work experience
In the next paragraph you can write more about your previous work experience, highlight some of your skills and 
also mention which impact you made in previous jobs.

### The Job opportunity you're applying to
After you gave some insight into your work experience, you should explain what you like about the job opportunity,
the company and how you can add value to them. Mention what you bring to the table and what you think you can learn from them.

### Outro
Finish your cover letter and mention that you would be happy about the opportunity to introduce yourself in an interview.
