# 1. Interview Prep :microphone:


## Prepare for different kinds of interviews :crystal_ball:
Most companies have several steps of interviewing, and they all have their own structure for that. 
Some will tell you before how the application process steps with their company will look like -  and some don't.
If they don't tell you the process right before, just reach out to your contact person and ask.
Knowing what kind of interview is coming will make the preparation for the next step easier.
Some companies start with a technical interview immediately, some have an initial interview with a recruiter
at first, and some do a mix of initial, tech and cultural fit.
Even if most people fear the technical part the most, you should still prepare other interviews too.

Big companies often have longer interview processes than small companies and startups. However, the intensity
of the interview process probably doesn't have correlation to how hard the job itself will be.

**The trick is to prepare, without stressing and over preparing** :sparkles:

## Initial interview with a recruiter :telephone_receiver:
An initial phone (or video) call with a recruiter is something a lot of companies do in their application process.
Sometimes the initial interview is done with a developer or another technical person. To be sure what kind
of professional background the interviewer has, look on LinkedIn (if you don't know already).
The initial interview is often a short interview to get to know you and pre-check if you could be a good match both technical
and personal. You will most likely get asked to tell something about yourself. Prepare a short talk about yourself and use
the opportunity to highlight the things that are important to you and relevant for the position.
If you're switching jobs you'll also need to answer why you want to leave your previous job and why you chose this
position to apply to. Sometimes you still get asked some technical questions. With a company recruiter they probably
want to check if you can explain some technical context to a non-technical person. If the initial interview
is with a person from the technical field, they probably do a pre-check on your tech skills.
Behavioral / cultural fit questions can be also asked in an initial interview. This is not often the case, but it's still
good to be aware that this can happen.
An initial interview is your first chance to make a good impression and because initial interviews can vary a lot
between companies, it's good to be prepared for different scenarios.


## The technical interview

Technical interviews are hard :fire:
You'll never know what will happen. You will have to answer a ton of technical questions and sometimes 
you have to do live coding or even writing pseudo code on a white board (luckily, I never had to do that).
**Not knowing how to answer all the questions is totally fine**, your potential future colleagues just want
to grasp your knowledge very well to assess your current level.

Try to not rage study everything at once and instead prepare with structure.

### The tech stack
Having blind spots in the companies tech stack is totally normal. Every job requires a different set of technologies,
and you don't need to be a pro in all of them.

1. make a list :memo:
Make a list of your technical skills (from your CV) and compare it to the tech stack from the job you're applying to.
Highlight the matches :arrow_right: this will be your focus.
   
2. check the blind spots :black_circle:
Take all the technologies from the stack that you didn't highlight and do a **small**
research. Write down what this technology is used for, and a bit of common information about it.
Don't spent too much time on that. When you get asked about these technologies, you can
show that you have some common knowledge about it and show some interest about it, but also be honest and
say that you don't have experience in using it. 
   
3. prepare your skills :star:
More important than knowing how to answer :sparkles:everything:sparkles: from the tech stack is to have solid
answers for the technologies you know. Take all the highlighted technologies from the list and prepare common
interview questions for these technologies.
F.e. if you have Javascript experience, and the job also asks for Javascript knowledge research
common Javascript interview questions. Look at 3-4 resources. You will see that some resources have similar
questions on their list. Focus on the most mentioned questions first, as you can't prepare every single
question that exists. Take notes :pencil2: or create tables in notion, excel or a program of your choice.
Make sure to also bookmark :pushpin: useful websites and resources.   
   
4. prepare questions :grey_question:
Preparing questions is also a very important part for interviews. Some of your questions might
get answered during the interview, so I would suggest preparing a few backup questions (ask 2-4 questions, prepare 6-8).   

   
### during the tech interview :hourglass:

During the interview the most important thing is to stay calm. Have some water by your side and pen + paper
to take some notes. 

#### if you don't know how to answer a question
Don't try to make something up, be honest or ask questions to get further information on what they want to refer to.
It's fine if you can't answer some things. They ask a lot of questions to evaluate your current level.
Note the questions you couldn't answer :clipboard: (especially if there were questions about a technology you know
that you couldn't answer).

#### if you know the answer
This is your moment to shine :sparkles:
Take your time and don't talk to fast. Show that you have experience in the asked area.
Don't answer too short, it's fine to show a little of :sparkler:extra:sparkler: information on the asked topic.
Talking too much unnecessary stuff is also not recommended. **Balance is key**
