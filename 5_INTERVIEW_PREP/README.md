# 1. Interview Prep :microphone:


## Prepare for different kinds of interviews :crystal_ball:
Most companies have several steps of interviewing, and they all have their own structure for that. 
Some will tell you before how the application process steps with their company will look like -  and some don't.
If they don't tell you the process right before, just reach out to your contact person and ask.
Knowing what kind of interview is coming will make the preparation for the next step easier.
Some companies start with a technical interview immediately, some have an initial interview with a recruiter
at first, and some do a mix of initial, tech and cultural fit.
Even if most people fear the technical part the most, you should still prepare other interviews too.

Big companies often have longer interview processes than small companies and startups. However, the intensity
of the interview process probably doesn't have correlation to how hard the job itself will be.

## Initial interview with a recruiter :telephone_receiver:
An initial phone (or video) call with a recruiter is something a lot of companies do in their application process.
Sometimes the initial interview is done with a developer or another technical person. To be sure what kind
of professional background the interviewer has, look on LinkedIn (if you don't know already).
The initial interview is often a short interview to get to know you and pre-check if you could be a good match both technical
and personal. You will most likely get asked to tell something about yourself. Prepare a short talk about yourself and use
the opportunity to highlight the things that are important to you and relevant for the position.
If you're switching jobs you'll also need to answer why you want to leave your previous job and why you chose this
position to apply to. Sometimes you still get asked some technical questions. With a company recruiter they probably
want to check if you can explain some technical context to a non-technical person. If the initial interview
is with a person from the technical field, they probably do a pre-check on your tech skills.
Behavioral / cultural fit questions can be also asked in an initial interview. This is not often the case but it's still
good to be aware that this can happen.
An initial interview is your first chance to make a good impression and because initial interviews can vary a lot
between companies, it's good to be prepared for different scenarios.
