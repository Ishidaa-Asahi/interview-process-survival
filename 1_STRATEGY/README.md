# 1. Strategy :chart_with_upwards_trend:

If you're just starting to apply, or if your applications didn't bring the results 
you were hoping for yet, it may help to set up or review your strategy.


## Why I believe a strategy is important :pray:

A strategy can save you time, makes your process a lot more efficient and gives you confidence through applying.
Applying is exhausting, and you don't want to waste time or energy.


## Important components of your strategy :pick:

### What do you want your next career step to be like?

Are you searching for a position with more experienced devs from whom you can learn or do you want to work in
a leading position or as a senior?
Are you seeking for more independence to get more confident in your job or are you
searching for a bigger team with lots of collaboration?
Which technologies do you want to work with?

### What kind of company do you want to work for?

Do you want to work in a big company or startup? Or maybe something in between.
Do you prefer specific industries? Are you interested in working in an agency?

### Where do you want to work?

Are you searching for a job in your hometown or do you fancy working in a new city or even abroad?
Is a remote position something you are looking for?

### What's your salary expectation?

This depends on your working experience and also on your location. Research salaries for your preferred location
and try to define a reasonable salary expectation based on that :money_with_wings:.
Keep in mind that salaries can also vary based on company size and other factors.

### What's something you don't want?

Knowing what you don't want is as important as knowing what you want. Think about your past working experiences, what was
good about it and what wasn't. What were things you wanted to change? :triangular_flag_on_post:	 What are red flags for you?


## How to know to how many jobs you should apply?

### Juniors

As a junior quantity matters a lot more than for a more experienced dev.
You don't need to apply to every single job you find, but I suggest you to apply even if
+ you only know 30% of the tech stack
+ the job asks for 2 years of experience
+ the job is not 100% what you are looking for

It's harder in the beginning, and you need to do more research and possibly put in more effort than others.
Interview experience will also help you a lot, so try to apply to lots of jobs to get interviews.

### Mid-Levels (1-2+ Years of experience)

Your first experience will make the job hunt a lot easier, but the interviews and coding challenges will also get a bit harder.
Quantity isn't the most important thing anymore, but I would still suggest sending out a few more applications,
so you can compare jobs, get more interview experience, and you're prepared for a few possible rejections.

### Senior (5+ Years of experience)

**Disclaimer:** most companies have a own definition of how many years of experience you need to be considered a Senior.
As far as I noticed, more than 5 years is the most common definition.

If you have 5+ years of experience, you can be more picky with jobs you want to apply to. 
It can be useful for you to be extra sensitive with research before applying. Applying to more than
just 2 opportunities can still benefit you -> it gives you the chance to compare and choose if you have 
a few offers on the table. Getting interviews is a lot easier as a Senior, but the Interviews itself
will be more challenging. A company that wants to hire (and pay) a Senior wants to be sure, that you can
prove that you are a Senior.

## Build or use your Network

Your Network doesn't only consist of you ex colleagues and classmates. Do you know anyone
who works at a company that might has interesting job opportunities for you? Your best friends Mum,
your Aunts Dog Hairdressers Sister, someone from your sports club?

If there's a job offer out there that you like, and you have the opportunity to get a **referral**
this will increase your chance to get interviewed.

If you see a job ad and find the recruiters name, you can try to find them on LinkedIn and reach out to them.
